title: Code Breaks... So What Now
description: Get started with the workshop project
---

Welcome to debugging hell! Wait, I mean... welcome to our hands-on workshop. We've got a "slightly broken" application called Unborked—a revolutionary marketplace where developers can buy things that ultimately they can get cheaper off of other sides; but they buy from us beacuse of "brand loyalty". Unfortunately, Unborked itself is experiencing a collection of fascinating bugs, from performance issues to checkout problems to mysterious transaction failures.

But don't worry—by the end of this workshop, you'll be fixing errors like a pro, or at least getting into a place where you can hide them really well.

## Meet Unborked: The Buggiest Error Marketplace Ever

Unborked is built with Laravel and React and includes:

- User authentication (when it works)
- Product listings to help you buy the cheapest things (sometimes)
- API endpoints that occasionally decide to take a vacation
- A database connection that's having an existential crisis
- Performance issues that would make a sloth look speedy

These aren't bugs—they're learning opportunities! And we're going to catch every single one.

### Running Locally 

In the quickstart we made sure we ran the project, but just in case you skipped - make sure you've started it with... 

```bash
npm run build 
composer run dev:ssr
```

Once complete, this should have you up and running on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).


## Is It Working? (Define "Working")

Now that you've got Unborked running (sort of), take a moment to click around and experience our carefully crafted chaos:

1. Things are pretttttty slow on the massive product page at the landing 
2. The checkout functionality has chacked out... like... it doesn't work
3. 

## Next Steps

Now that we've got our gloriously broken application up and running, it's time to add some error monitoring, and a lot of tracing! 

In the [next section](/configure-sentry/), we'll install Sentry to start catching these errors and figuring out what's actually going wrong.
