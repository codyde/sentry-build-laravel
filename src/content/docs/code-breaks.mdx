title: Code Breaks... So What Now
description: Get started with the workshop project

Welcome to our hands-on workshop! We've got an ecommerce application called Unborked — a revolutionary marketplace where developers can buy things. Unfortunately, Unborked is experiencing some interesting issues that we'll help you debug using Sentry.

## Meet Unborked: The Marketplace with Issues

Unborked is built with Laravel and React and includes:

- A product marketplace with performance issues
- An Add to Cart button that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't
- A checkout process that fails under certain conditions
- Real-world debugging scenarios that you'll encounter in production

These aren't just bugs—they're real-world scenarios that we'll help you debug using Sentry's powerful tools!

### Running Locally

In the quickstart we made sure we ran the project, but just in case you skipped - make sure you've started it with...

```bash
npm run build
composer run dev:ssr
```

Once complete, this should have you up and running on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## The Issues We'll Debug

Now that you've got Unborked running, let's explore the issues we'll be debugging:

1. **Performance Issues**: The marketplace is running slower than expected, with page loads taking over 1.5 seconds. We'll use Sentry's performance monitoring to identify and fix the bottlenecks.

2. **Flaky Add to Cart**: The Add to Cart button sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, with cryptic error messages in production. We'll learn how to add proper error context and fix the underlying issues.

3. **Checkout Problems**: The checkout process fails under certain conditions. We'll use Sentry's Seer AI, Session Replay, and Breadcrumbs to understand and fix these complex issues.

## Next Steps

Now that we've got our application up and running and understand the issues we'll be tackling, it's time to add Sentry to start catching these errors and figuring out what's actually going wrong.

In the [next section](/configure-sentry/), we'll install Sentry to start catching these errors and figuring out what's actually going wrong.
