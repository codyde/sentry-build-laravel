So we've got Sentry installed now; great. Let's get to exploring what's going on with Unborked.

## Houston, We Have Several Problems

Picture this: You visit Unborked's marketplace, eager to pick up some sweet swag, and you're waiting... and waiting... and waiting.

Something's clearly wrong but you can't quite put your fingers on what. Fortunately, we've got monitoring for that! 

## Sentry's Laravel Framework View 

Did you know Sentry built a framework view for Laravel? If you head into Insights > Backend, select your project, you'll see it! This view is great for giving you a view into errors and performance that matches up with what you would expect from 
Laravel

This framework view gives you performance insights into 

- Requests and Error Rates 
- Current Issues 
- Connection Duration 
- Jobs 
- Slow database queries 
- Cache misses 
- And per route performance

If we dive into our route, we can quickly tell that performance is decidedly **not good**.

In this view, we can quickly see that the total load time for our main site in most case exceeds 1.5 seconds; which is pretty atrocious for a site that should be loading up quickly to allow purchases.

## Trace View - Part 1 

If we dive into any of the transactions, we can see a detailed view of the overall trace, and the spans below it that cover the load time for our application.

A couple of insights we can immediately notice:
- These traces are 80% slower than the average
- The majority of time is coming from a /render call thats being made 
- Our database queries are fast in comparison; so its a different aspect of loading thats slowing us down 

We can instrument custom traces to help us identify where the performance is going down.
