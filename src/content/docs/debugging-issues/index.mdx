So we've got Sentry installed now; great. Let's get to exploring what's going on with Unborked.

## Houston, We Have Several Problems

Picture this: You visit Unborked's marketplace, eager to pick up some sweet swag, and you're waiting... and waiting... and waiting. Infact, lets not picture it - lets actually see it! 

To get started, run the following command to start the application:

```bash
composer run dev:ssr
```

This will build our applications frontend, spin up the backend, and give us our application running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Open it up and lets kick the tires! 

## Sentry's Laravel Framework View 

Did you know Sentry built a framework view for Laravel? If you head into Insights > Backend, select your project, you'll see it! This view is great for giving you a view into errors and performance that matches up with what you would expect from 
Laravel

![Laravel Framework View](/../../assets/img/SentryLaravelView.png)

This framework view gives you performance insights into 

- Requests and Error Rates 
- Current Issues 
- Connection Duration 
- Jobs 
- Slow database queries 
- Cache misses 
- And per route performance

We'll be using this view to help us identify where the performance is going down.

Enough talking about it; lets get into Unborking this.
